Issue 02

Discussion:

Add a mechanism to catch errors and display them to the user with a possible solution.

This was included in Issue 01 but not solved.

Possible solution is to have a listener that will monitor a location for errors to show up and then handle the display.

Another possible solution is to have a return type of error that the calling program handles.

I kind of like the first solution because then an error does not have to be pushed up through several layers.
